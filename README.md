# GameReviews

Welcome to the Game Reviews gem! With this gem you will be able to get information about your favorite game's review (as if the gem title wasn't self explanatory already) at the 'press' of a button, well you will have to do some simply typing, but nonetheless very simple. It is designed for you the 'user' to interact with the CLI to pull up information about the game of your choice. You will be able to see a very brief description, who reviewed the game, and a link to the actual site to view more information. I hope you enjoy it as much I did to create it, have fun!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'game_reviews'

Or install it yourself as:

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
